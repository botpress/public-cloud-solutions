# Salesforce Messaging HITL

## Description

This integration makes Salesforce Messaging available as a channel for Human-in-the-loop on Botpress

## Configuration on Salesforce

You need to configure your Salesforce environment to use "Messaging for In-App and Web" first, since the configuration will depend on your business and is made exclusively on Salesforce, no steps will be provided here, but here are a few resources that can help.

Please reach out to Salesforce regarding any question regarding the setup of "Messaging for In-App and Web"

### Configuration on Botpress

After "Messaging for In-App and Web" is working on your Salesforce instance (Make sure to test this using Salesforce tools), you will need to create a new Embedded Service Deployment on Salesforce to use to generate credentials for Botpress.
